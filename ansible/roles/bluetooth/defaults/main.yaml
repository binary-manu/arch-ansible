# Controls if Bluetooth support is installed or not:
#
# * leave it empty to use the default behaviour, which installs
#   BT on bare metal systems only;
# * set to `active` to force installation even under hypervisors;
# * set to `inactive` to disable BT support.
#
# Other values are errors, and supported values are case-sensitive.
