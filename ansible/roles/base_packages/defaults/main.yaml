  # Arch's base packages
  - base
  - base-devel
  # These packages used to be included in the "base" group. Now they must be
  # installed explicitly. Note that I just diffed what the base group included
  # against the direct dependencies of the base package, so it is likely that
  # some of these packages are already pulled in by base.
